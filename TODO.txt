### All of these are moved to Highlighter2 TODO section in README.md
  * detect a path [/path/path/...] (see c.lang file) (see how '#include < aaa >' is done)
  * use ` code goes here ` to make a code block with different font?
  * use \_word\_ to make italic
  * use \_\_word\_\_ to make bold (as here: https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview)
[X] + '< + [letter] + [space]' (HAS TO HAVE A SPACE IN IT)
[X] SAME THING IN THE CASE OF '/' + 'r'
* Make the line comments active only at the beginning of lines
This is a new line /r ....... invalid
